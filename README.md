# Wolt Delivery Order Price Calculator service (DOPC)
 
Task is to implement the Delivery Order Price Calculator service, or DOPC for short! DOPC is an imaginary backend service which is capable of calculating the total price and price breakdown of a delivery order. DOPC integrates with the Home Assignment API to fetch venue related data required to calculate the prices. The term venue refers to any kind of restaurant / shop / store that's in Wolt. Let's not make strict assumptions about the potential clients of DOPC: they might be other backend services, Wolt's consumer mobile apps, or even some third parties which integrate with Wolt.
